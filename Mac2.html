The Apple 2 remained a big seller however, attempts to produce a successor in the form of the Lisa and the Apple 3 failed miserably. Nonetheless, Jobs continued to remain confident in his products. He predicted that Apple would sell 50,000 Macs in its first 100 days (about 3 and a half months). Apple reached that goal by April 6. By May 3  or the 100th day Apple had sold 72,000 Macs. Sales slowed, and Apple did not hit the 1 million Mac mark until March 1987. Far from a repeat of the Apple III failure, the Mac nevertheless became an early setback for the company.
