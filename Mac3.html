It represented Apple's first step towards eliminating redundancy and complexity in the product line by replacing eight Power Macintosh models and the Macintosh Twentieth Anniversary with three Desktop and Mini Tower models for professional and home use, and an All-in-one model for education. The introduction of the Desktop and Mini Tower models coincided with Apple starting to sell build-to-order Macs directly from its web site in an online store, which was unusual for the time as Dell was the only major computer manufacturer doing this. Apple's move to build-to-order sales of the Power Macintosh G3 also coincided with the acquisition of Power Computing Corporation, which had been providing telephone sales of Macintosh clones for more than two years. <br>
