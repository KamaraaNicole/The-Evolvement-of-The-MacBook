The MacBook Pro was Introduced on January 10th back in 2006, it is the higher-end lineup or one of the better selling
products in the MacBook family, sitting just above the more consumer-focused MacBook Air. It is now currently being sold with 14 and 16-inch screens, while still using all of Appleâ€™s 
silicon M-series chips. It's now 16 years years since he did that, which means we've had the MacBook Pro for longer than Apple's original portables. And where the MacBook Pro was
 then introduced during the changeover from PowerPC to Intel processors, today the MacBook Pro is a key part of the change from Intel to Apple Silicon. <br>
