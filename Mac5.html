 panel and a bump in hardware. Before the new MacBook Pro arrived, the laptop’s design was around four years old. Even with that seemingly outdated design, the 2015 laptop still
  looks and feels as fresh as the day Apple first unveiled it. The 2015 13-inch model weighs just 1.58kg and is 18mm thick, which isn’t as thin as the new 13-inch model, which 
  measures in at 14.9mm. In terms of the 15-inch models, the previous design weighs 2.04kg and is also 18mm thick, while the new 15-inch model comes in at 15.5mm. Both the old 
  and new models are highly portable, but the 2016 versions are undoubtedly more compact. <br>
