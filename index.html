        <td>It’s easy to forget today, but when Apple first launched the Macintosh in 1984, the company was coming off a couple of high-profile failures. The Apple 2 remained a big seller however, attempts to produce a successor in the form of the Lisa and the Apple 3 failed miserably. Nonetheless, Jobs continued to remain confident in his products. He predicted that Apple would sell 50,000 Macs in its first 100 days (about 3 and a half months). Apple reached that goal by April 6. By May 3  or the 100th day Apple had sold 72,000 Macs. Sales slowed, and Apple did not hit the 1 million Mac mark until March 1987. Far from a repeat of the Apple III failure, the Mac nevertheless became an early setback for the company. </td>
        <td>These devices will almost single-handedly turn notebook computers into mainstream technology. Apple’s subsequent success in this category — whether it’s the current MacBooks or even the rise of mobile devices like the iPhone — owes a huge debt to the PowerBook 100 series. By modern standards, the PowerBook 100 series is the first true laptop Apple released. By comparison, the October 1991 PowerBooks came in three configurations: the low-end PowerBook 100, the midlevel PowerBook 140 and the high-end PowerBook 170. These ranged in price from $2,300 to $4,599. The PowerBook 100 series seemed to come as an unexpected hit for Apple. Then-CEO John Sculley gave the PowerBook project a marketing budget of $1 million, considerably less than the money available to the makers of Apple’s desktop Macs and the advertising push paid off. </td>

         <p>These are 2 different examples of some of MacBook's creations, one is a laptop and the other is a desktop both MacBooks. MacBooks have a built-in camera located on the top of the device, the MacBook Pro has a 720p webcam installed. 
            Although these are 1 to 2 thousand dollar computers they're very high tech and meet the standards of the price. </p>
