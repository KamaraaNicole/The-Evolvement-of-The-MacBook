        <td>It’s easy to forget today, but when Apple first launched the Macintosh in 1984, the company was coming off a couple of high-profile failures. The Apple 2 remained a big seller however, attempts to produce a successor in the form of the Lisa and the Apple 3 failed miserably. Nonetheless, Jobs continued to remain confident in his products. He predicted that Apple would sell 50,000 Macs in its first 100 days (about 3 and a half months). Apple reached that goal by April 6. By May 3  or the 100th day Apple had sold 72,000 Macs. Sales slowed, and Apple did not hit the 1 million Mac mark until March 1987. Far from a repeat of the Apple III failure, the Mac nevertheless became an early setback for the company. </td>
        <td>These devices will almost single-handedly turn notebook computers into mainstream technology. Apple’s subsequent success in this category — whether it’s the current MacBooks or even the rise of mobile devices like the iPhone — owes a huge debt to the PowerBook 100 series. By modern standards, the PowerBook 100 series is the first true laptop Apple released. By comparison, the October 1991 PowerBooks came in three configurations: the low-end PowerBook 100, the midlevel PowerBook 140 and the high-end PowerBook 170. These ranged in price from $2,300 to $4,599. The PowerBook 100 series seemed to come as an unexpected hit for Apple. Then-CEO John Sculley gave the PowerBook project a marketing budget of $1 million, considerably less than the money available to the makers of Apple’s desktop Macs and the advertising push paid off. </td>
        <td>The Power Macintosh G3 also sold with additional software, as the Macintosh Server G3 is a series of personal computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple computer from November 1997 to August 1999. It represented Apple's first step towards eliminating redundancy and complexity in the product line by replacing eight Power Macintosh models and the Macintosh Twentieth Anniversary with three Desktop and Mini Tower models for professional and home use, and an All-in-one model for education. The introduction of the Desktop and Mini Tower models coincided with Apple starting to sell build-to-order Macs directly from its web site in an online store, which was unusual for the time as Dell was the only major computer manufacturer doing this. Apple's move to build-to-order sales of the Power Macintosh G3 also coincided with the acquisition of Power Computing Corporation, which had been providing telephone sales of Macintosh clones for more than two years. </td>
     <td>The MacBook Pro is a line of Mac laptops made by Apple Inc. The MacBook Pro was Introduced on January 10th back in 2006, it is the higher-end lineup or one of the better selling products in the MacBook family, sitting just above the more consumer-focused MacBook Air. It is now currently being sold with 14 and 16-inch screens, while still using all of Apple’s silicon M-series chips. It's now 16 years years since he did that, which means we've had the MacBook Pro for longer than Apple's original portables. And where the MacBook Pro was then introduced during the changeover from PowerPC to Intel processors, today the MacBook Pro is a key part of the change from Intel to Apple Silicon. </td>
     <td>Apple has finally taken the wraps off its new and more previously released MacBook Pros, and they look like some impressive machines, coming complete with that long-rumored OLED panel and a bump in hardware. Before the new MacBook Pro arrived, the laptop’s design was around four years old. Even with that seemingly outdated design, the 2015 laptop still looks and feels as fresh as the day Apple first unveiled it. The 2015 13-inch model weighs just 1.58kg and is 18mm thick, which isn’t as thin as the new 13-inch model, which measures in at 14.9mm. In terms of the 15-inch models, the previous design weighs 2.04kg and is also 18mm thick, while the new 15-inch model comes in at 15.5mm. Both the old and new models are highly portable, but the 2016 versions are undoubtedly more compact. </td>

         <p>These are 2 different examples of some of MacBook's creations, one is a laptop and the other is a desktop both MacBooks. MacBooks have a built-in camera located on the top of the device, the MacBook Pro has a 720p webcam installed. 
            Although these are 1 to 2 thousand dollar computers they're very high tech and meet the standards of the price. </p>
